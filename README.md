### 1. Project Overview<a id="project"></a>
This project has done to demonstrate my data cleaning ability.

### 2. Process<a id="process"></a>
- Data was downloaded from [_Kaggle_](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmthyjames/nashville-housing-data/code) on July 14, 2022. 
- The data set was not modified before loading into Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio. 
- Performed 6 basic cleaning tasks:
    1. Standardize date format
    2. Populate property address data
    3. Split address into individual columns
    4. Change "Y" and "N" to "Yes" and "No" in "Sold as Vacant" field
    5. Remove duplicates
    6. Delete unused columns

### 3. Project Motivation<a id="motivation"></a>
- Most of these tasks I'd normally do in Power BI. However, it is good to know that I have the ability to clean the data at an earlier stage, if needed.
- This project will form a part of my portfolio and with aim to demonstate to future employers my ability and potential. It was good practice to apply what I've learned through Datacamp and Udacity and have a set of queries I can refer to in the future. Skills used: joins, self-joins, string manipulation, case functions, CTE's, window functions, data type conversion, altering tables, updating, deleting, and adding columns.
